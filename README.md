COde Refactor Assignment

Goal:

This homework assignment was to refactor existing code by making the page fully accessible and fixing errors. 

My Actions:

Alt tags were added in order to describe photos for visual impaired users. Semantic HTML tags help to convey the structure of the web pages content so that it can be parsed and interpreted by technology such as screen readers. 

In order to accomplish this I added needed tags and corrected CSS. I also fixed HTML coding errors as well.

Relevance:

Considering that website should be accessible for all people who are attemping to view them, it is important to make sure to include all pertinent elements.

Comments:

Prior to this assignment, I did not realize web page coders and designers have to take note of how different visitors will be interacting with the page. I also learned that it is important to account for accessibility considerations in the beginning of a project otherwise there could be some pricey code refactoring involved with returning to the code and editing.
